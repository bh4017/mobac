Example custom map definition that uses an existing OSMTracker atlas. 
Atlases that very similar to OSMTracker like AndNav,
Maverick and OSMAND are also supported.

Quad-key based map sources as they are created by MapCruncher are also supported.
They can be selected via <sourceType> entry.  

Supported file formats are PNG, JPG and GIF files.  

This file work with MOBAC 1.9.3 and higher
