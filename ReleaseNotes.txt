 Upgrading from version prior to 1.7:
 
 Starting with MOBAC v1.7 the tile store format has changed. MOBAC now uses a 
 database (BerkelyDB) based tile store instead of saving each image files 
 separately in the file system. 
 
 Existing tile stores are NOT CONVERTED into the new database format because 
 the files in the file system are missing relevant information. Existing old
 tile stores are ignored.
 
 Therefore it is recommended to install MOBAC into a clean directory. 
 Existing atlas profiles (tac-profile*.xml) created with versions prior to v1.7 
 can usually can be reused by copying them into the current directory of MOBAC.
 Upon next start of MOBAC they will be automatically renamed and will be 
 available from the atlas profile selector.
